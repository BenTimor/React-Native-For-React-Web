# Instructor Notes - Bucket List App Workshop

## üìã Pre-Workshop Checklist

### One Week Before
- [ ] Share repository link with students
- [ ] Send setup instructions (Node.js, Expo Go app)
- [ ] Ask students to run `npm install` and test app boots

### Day Before
- [ ] Ensure your demo device is ready
- [ ] Test the QR code scanning flow
- [ ] Prepare backup: have iOS Simulator/Android Emulator ready
- [ ] Review CHECKLIST.md to refresh on teaching points

### 30 Minutes Before
- [ ] Start the app on your device (`npx expo start`)
- [ ] Have CHECKLIST.md open and ready to share screen
- [ ] Open VS Code with the project
- [ ] Test that students can connect

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timing Guide (40 Minutes)

### Introduction (5 min) - 0:00-0:05
- Brief overview of what we're building
- Show the finished app (uncomment all code beforehand on your demo)
- Explain the philosophy: "Same React, different primitives"
- Point them to CHECKLIST.md

### Steps 1-3: Core List Features (15 min) - 0:05-0:20
**Step 1 - Display List (5 min)**
- Live code: Show creating a simple array
- Explain FlatList vs .map()
- Let students try before showing solution
- Check-in: "Everyone seeing a list?"

**Step 2 - Add Items (5 min)**
- Explain Modal component (built-in!)
- Show TextInput and onChangeText
- Highlight: Same useState as web!
- Walk through uncommenting the hook
- Check-in: "Can everyone add items?"

**Step 3 - Delete Items (5 min)**
- Quick challenge: "How would you filter in React web?"
- Show Alert.alert() demo
- Emphasize: Array methods are identical!
- Check-in: "Deletion working for everyone?"

### Steps 4-5: Enhanced Features (10 min) - 0:20-0:30
**Step 4 - Descriptions (3 min)**
- Quick step - mostly done already
- Point out conditional rendering
- Check-in: Quick show of hands

**Step 5 - Complete/Uncomplete (7 min)**
- This is the "aha!" moment
- Show .map() updating items
- Explain filtering for different tabs
- ISO dates work the same!
- Check-in: "Items moving between tabs?"

### Step 6: Data Persistence (8 min) - 0:30-0:38
- Compare to localStorage (syntax difference)
- async/await is the key difference
- useEffect loads data - just like fetching!
- Have them add item, reload app
- Check-in: "Data persisting after reload?"

### Step 7: Polish (2 min) - 0:38-0:40
- Quick date formatting challenge
- Point out empty states (already done)
- Celebrate completion!

### Wrap-up & Advanced (Optional) - 0:40+
- Show advanced challenges for quick learners
- Image picker demo if time allows
- Q&A
- Share resources

## üéØ Teaching Tips

### Pacing Strategies

**If Running Behind**
- Skip Step 4 (descriptions) - it's bonus
- Combine Steps 6 & 7 (persistence + polish)
- Have working solutions ready to paste

**If Running Ahead**
- Dive deeper into FlatList optimization
- Show advanced Step features
- Demo image picker
- Explain animations

### Common Student Questions

**"Why can't I just use `<div>`?"**
‚Üí React Native doesn't run in a browser - it compiles to native iOS/Android components. `View` becomes `UIView` on iOS and `android.view.ViewGroup` on Android.

**"Is AsyncStorage like localStorage?"**
‚Üí Similar purpose, different API! localStorage is synchronous, AsyncStorage is async because mobile storage I/O can be slower.

**"Can I use my React libraries?"**
‚Üí Only if they're React-only (no DOM dependencies). Libraries like Redux, React Query work. Styling libraries usually need RN-specific versions.

**"Why FlatList instead of .map()?"**
‚Üí Performance! FlatList only renders visible items (virtualization). With .map(), all items render even off-screen. Critical for long lists.

**"What about TypeScript?"**
‚Üí It's optional but recommended! The template includes types to help you learn. Remove types if you prefer vanilla JavaScript.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Student Can't See App
1. Check WiFi - same network?
2. Try tunnel mode: `npx expo start --tunnel`
3. Firewall blocking? Check security settings
4. Last resort: Use web version (press 'w')

### App Crashes on Reload
- Usually AsyncStorage parsing error
- Check `loadItems` has try/catch
- Verify JSON.parse has fallback

### TypeScript Errors Confusing Students
- Reassure: It's helping catch bugs!
- Can remove type annotations if overwhelming
- Focus on the logic, ignore red squiggles for now

### Metro Bundler Issues
```bash
# Clear cache and restart
npx expo start -c
```

## üé® Live Coding Tips

### What to Code Live
- ‚úÖ Step 1: Array creation and FlatList
- ‚úÖ Step 3: Delete function (simple filter)
- ‚úÖ Step 5: Toggle complete (.map example)

### What to Show Pre-coded
- ‚ùå Modal setup (too boilerplate-heavy)
- ‚ùå Styling (not the focus)
- ‚ùå TypeScript interfaces (show but don't dwell)

### Debugging Live
If something breaks:
1. Shake device ‚Üí Reload
2. Check console for errors
3. Use console.log() - just like web!
4. Show Chrome DevTools (Expo docs)

## üìä Learning Checkpoints

Ask these questions to gauge understanding:

**After Step 1:**
"What's the difference between FlatList and .map()?"
‚úÖ Expected: FlatList is optimized, virtualizes items

**After Step 2:**
"How is useState different in React Native?"
‚úÖ Expected: It's not! Exactly the same

**After Step 5:**
"How do we show different data in each tab?"
‚úÖ Expected: Filter the same data source differently

**After Step 6:**
"What's the main difference from localStorage?"
‚úÖ Expected: AsyncStorage is asynchronous

## üéì Key Messages to Reinforce

1. **"It's still React!"**
   - Components, props, state, hooks - all the same
   - Just different building blocks

2. **"Mobile is async!"**
   - Storage, images, permissions - all async APIs
   - Get comfortable with async/await

3. **"Performance matters more"**
   - FlatList virtualization
   - Avoid heavy re-renders
   - 60 FPS is the goal

4. **"Platform differences exist"**
   - Some things work differently on iOS vs Android
   - Test on both when possible

- ‚úÖ Explain how React Native relates to React web
- ‚úÖ Use core RN components (View, Text, FlatList, Pressable)

- ‚úÖ Navigate between screens
- ‚úÖ Feel confident building a simple RN app

## üí° Extension Ideas

For future workshops:
- Authentication with Firebase
- API integration (fetch works!)
- Camera integration
- Push notifications
- Publishing to App Store/Play Store

## üéâ Closing

**Good luck with the workshop! üöÄ**

Remember: Your students already know React - you're just teaching them a new rendering target. Build confidence by highlighting similarities, not differences.
